## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! This portfolio was quite the passion project for me (who doesn't love to show off their work in a beautiful way!), so I hope you enjoy viewing my page as much as I enjoyed creating it.

### Technologies

Being my first react application, has been quite the learning experience, bringing together many of the previous front end technologies I've previously used but within a new context. Here are the major technologies used:
* React
* CSS
* Bootstrap (Mostly for layouts and grid, most of the actual style created with custom CSS)
* Materialize (Exclusively for form elements)
* JSX
Since beginning this journey as a developer, I've worked with so many technologies to create visually appealing applications, even alternative templating engines like handlebars. But I can confidently say React is here to say for my front end needs. JSX in particular is perhaps the easiest to work with for compiling HTML, and even easier to apply styles, all while maintaining a modularized file structure. I couldn't be happier that I chose to learn this javascript library, and I'm even more excited to learn alternative libraries.

### Future Development

This application will eventually host all my projects, but with pagination to avoid a cluttered screen.
